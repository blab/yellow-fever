<h1>Yellow-Fever outbreaks in Africa and South America</h1>
<p>Click this link to go to my website:<a href ="https://ebaberga.github.io/yellow-fever"> YELLOWFEVER</a></p>
<h2>Project Question:</h3>
<ol>
<li>How similar or Different is the yellow fever outbreaks in Africa and Brazil?</li>
<li>Which African countries have the same or almost the similar Yellow Fever virus outbreak</li>
 
</ol>
<h3>Countries I am Specifically interested in:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Senegal</li>
  <li>Ethiopia</li>
  <li>Egypt</li>
  <li>Sudan</li>
  <li>Brazil</li>
  <li>Mali</li>
  <li>Nigeria</li>
  <li>Gambia</li>
  <li>Mauritania</li>
  <li>Uganda</li>
</ul>
<p>All my sequence are draged from ViPR  http://www.viprbrc.org/brc/vipr_genome_search.spg?method=SubmitForm&blockId=2713&decorator=flavi</p>
<h3>I used the following application softwares throughout my project to do multiple tasks:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Iphyton: to build my subdata sets https://github.com/ebaberga/yellow-fever/blob/gh-pages/Ipython/Yellow-fever.ipynb </li>
<li>Geneious: to do my alignments using MAFT and draw a phylogenetic tree using RAFT of the sequences I filtered out using Iphyton.</li>
<li>Figtree: to graphically view my phylogenetic tree and publish ready figure.</li>
<li>Beauti: a companion program in Beast that generate XML file inorder to make the file readable by Beast. </li>
<li>Beast: to infer evolutionary dynamics from sequence data.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The following phylogenetic tree demostrate the distribution of different Yellow Fever outbreaks in different parts of Africa and Brazil based on the year they occured and the nucleiotide squence that helped make the virus:</h3>
<img src="tree(yellow fever).jpg" >
<h4>Things I understood from my Phylogenetic tree:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first Yello Fever outbreak was in Brazil 1955, and it is very different from that of the other outbreaks we have on the tree.</li>
<li>The majority of the outbreaks occured in West Africa since the year 1955 to 2005. </li>
<li>The virus doesn't jump from region to region very often, instead it stays in the area for a long time.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>How similar or Different is the yellow fever outbreaks in Africa and Brazil?</li>
</ol>
<h5>Hypothesis:</h5>
<p>The Yellow Fever viruses claimed to be the cause of Yellow Fever outbreak in Brazil shares the same last ancestor with the Yellow Fever outbreak virus in Both East and West Africa.</p>
