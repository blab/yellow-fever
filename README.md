<h1>Yellow-Fever outbreaks in Africa and South America</h1>
<h2>Project Question:</h3>
<ol>
<li>How similar or Different is the yellow fever outbreaks in Africa and Brazil?</li>
<li>Which African countries have the same or almost the similar Yellow Fever virus outbreak</li>
 
</ol>
<h3>Countries I am Specifically interested in:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Senegal</li>
  <li>Ethiopia</li>
  <li>Egypt</li>
  <li>Sudan</li>
  <li>Brazil</li>
  <li>Mali</li>
  <li>Nigeria</li>
  <li>Gambia</li>
  <li>Mauritania</li>
  <li>Uganda</li>
</ul>
<h3>The following phylogenetic tree demostrate the distribution of different Yellow Fever outbreaks in different parts of Africa and Brazil based on the year they occured and the nucleiotide squence that helped make the virus:</h3>
<img src="tree(yellow fever).jpg" >
<h4>Things I understood from the Phylogenetic tree:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The first Yello Fever outbreak was in Brazil 1955, and it is very different from that of the other outbreaks we have on the tree.</li>
<li>The majority of the outbreaks occured in West Africa since the year 1955 to 2005. </li>
<li>The virus doesn't jump from region to region very often, instead it stays in the area for a long time.</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
<li>If you are wondering ....... why?</li>
<ul>
<li>Pangea can explain alot why West African countries should have similar outbreaks as Brazil than other East African counties, if the distribution of Yellow Fever Virus was related to enviromental factors</li>
