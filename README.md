<h1>Yellow-Fever outbreaks in Africa and South America</h1>
<p>Click this link to go to my website:<a href ="https://ebaberga.github.io/yellow-fever"> YELLOWFEVER</a></p>
<h2>Project Question:</h3>
<ol>
<li>How similar or Different is the yellow fever outbreaks in Africa and Brazil?</li>
<li>What can we tell about the host distribution among this countries?</li>
 
</ol>
<h3>Countries I am Specifically interested in:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Senegal</li>
  <li>Ethiopia</li>
  <li>Egypt</li>
  <li>Sudan</li>
  <li>Brazil</li>
  <li>Mali</li>
  <li>Nigeria</li>
  <li>Gambia</li>
  <li>Mauritania</li>
  <li>Uganda</li>
</ul>
<p>All my sequence are draged from ViPR  http://www.viprbrc.org/brc/vipr_genome_search.spg?method=SubmitForm&blockId=2713&decorator=flavi</p>
<h3>I used the following application softwares throughout my project to do multiple tasks:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Iphyton: to build my subdata sets https://github.com/ebaberga/yellow-fever/blob/gh-pages/Ipython/Yellow-fever.ipynb </li>
<li>Geneious: to do my alignments using MAFT and draw a phylogenetic tree using RAFT of the sequences I filtered out using Iphyton.</li>
<li>Figtree: to graphically view my phylogenetic tree and publish ready figure.</li>
<li>Beauti: a companion program in Beast that generate XML file inorder to make the file readable by Beast. </li>
<li>Beast: to infer evolutionary dynamics from sequence data.</li>
</ol>
<h3>The following phylogenetic tree demostrate the distribution of different Yellow Fever outbreaks in different parts of Africa and Brazil based on the year they occured and the nucleiotide squence that helped make the virus:</h3>
<img src="tree(yellow fever).jpg" >
<h4>Things I understood from my Phylogenetic tree:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most of the mosquito hosts are found in African counties, while most human hosts are found in Brazil.</li>
<li>The virus tends to stay in a single types of hosts for a long time, it doesn't jump around other hosts often. </li>
<li>According to my data most of the hosts are mosquitos. So mosquitos could be more compatible with what the virus what to do.</li>
<li>The demonstrate that it is possible for Yellow Fever virus to jump from one species to another.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>How similar or Different is the yellow fever outbreaks in Africa and Brazil?</li>
</ol>
<h5>Hypothesis:</h5>
<p>The Yellow Fever viruses claimed to be the cause of Yellow Fever outbreak in Brazil shares the same last ancestor with the Yellow Fever outbreak virus in Both East and West Africa.</p>
