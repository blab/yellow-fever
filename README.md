##Project Questions
1. How similar or Different is yellow fever outbreaks in Africa and South America?
2. What can we tell about the host variation among this regions?

###Targeted regions of my project:
1. East Africa 
2. West Africa
3. South Africa

_The reason I chose these regions is because they have redundant outbreaks of Yellow Fever since its discovery in 1927._
###Steps towards building my phylogenetic tree:
1. Downloaded sequences of Yellow Fever virus from Africa and Brazil. 
2.  Made a python script using Jupyter Notebook that extracts sequences with a host of monkey, human being or mosquito, and sequences with a countries in  Africa and South America (Brazil & Venezuela).
3.  Imported my out put file from the script to Geneious. Then used MAFT in Geneious to do my alignments and RAFT to draw a tree. I used command line to do my aligment the second time. 
4.  Imported my alignment.fasta file from Geneious to Beauti inorder to add traits I wanted to express in my tree,country, host and region, and to convert the extension of the file from .fasta to .xml.
5.  Run Beast to infer evolutionary dynamics from sequence data.
6.  Created an mmc file using tree annotator, and displayed it with Figtree.

####Things I understood from my Phylogenetic tree:
* Most mosquito samples are from African counties, while most human samples are from South America(Brazil and Venezuela).
* The virus tends to stay in a specific region for a long time, it doesn't jump around different regions and hosts often.
* The tree demonstrate that it is possible for Yellow Fever virus to jump from one species to another.
