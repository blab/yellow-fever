<h1><b>What did I learned in these seven week:</b></h1>
<ol>
<h4> First week and Second week<a href= ""> HERE</a></h4>
<h4><Third week and Fourth week<a href= ""> HERE</a></h4>
<h4><Fifth week <a href= ""> HERE</a></h4>
</ol>
<h1>What was the problem:</h1>
<h2>Project Question </h3>
<ol>
<li>How similar or Different is the yellow fever outbreaks in different regions of the world?</li>
<li>What can we tell about the host variation among this regions?</li>
<h3>Regions I am Specifically interested in for my project:</h2>
<ol>
<li>East Africa </li>
<li>West Africa </li>
<li>South America </li>
</ol>
<P><b>The reason I chose these regions: There is high population size of Yellow Fever patients in this regions.</b></p>
<p>All my sequence are draged from <a href=" http://www.viprbrc.org/brc/vipr_genome_search.spg?method=SubmitForm&blockId=2713&decorator=flavi"</a> here </p>
<h3>I used the following application softwares throughout my project to do multiple tasks:</h3>
<ol>
<li> Jupyter Notebook: to build my subdata sets https://github.com/ebaberga/yellow-fever/blob/gh-pages/Ipython/Yellow-fever.ipynb </li>
<li> Geneious: to do my alignments using MAFT and draw a phylogenetic tree using RAFT of the sequences I filtered out using Jupyter Notebook (The first time I did it ).</li>
<li>Command line: to make my alignments for the 3rd time, and install most of the softwares I used so far.</li>
<li>Figtree: to graphically view my phylogenetic tree and publish ready figure.</li>
<li>Beauti: a companion program in Beast that generate XML file inorder to make the file readable by Beast. </li>
<li>Beast: to infer evolutionary dynamics from sequence data.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Why is these so important to me: I have a dream of pursuing a Computer Engineering degree in the near future. Using this software will broaden my understanding of computers in general, and make me a competitive college applicant.</b></p>
<h4>My final tree: </h4>
<h3>The following phylogenetic tree demonstrates the variation of hosts in East Africa, West Africa, and South America(Brazil and Venezuela):</h3>
<img src="tree.jpg" >
<h4>Things I understood from my Phylogenetic tree:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most of the mosquito hosts are found in African counties, while most human hosts are found in Brazil.</li>
<li>The virus tends to stay in a single type of host for a long time, it doesn't jump around other hosts often. </li>
<li>According to my data most of the hosts are mosquitos. So mosquitos could be more compatible with the viruses function.</li>
<li>The tree demonstrate that it is possible for Yellow Fever virus to jump from one species to another.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Hypothesis:</h5>
<p>Since the only means for the transmission of the virus from any host to a human being is through mosquitos, the outbreak in both region started when the virus suddenly jumped from a mosquito to a human being.</p>
<ol>
<li>What can we tell about the host variation among this region?</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that there have been a lot of outbreaks in Africa and Brazil make it suspicious  that almost all viruses in Brazil have a mosquito host not human. So my assumption is that researcher collected samples from Mosquitos in Brazil not humans.</p>
