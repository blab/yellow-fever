# Hypothesis:

1. How similar or Different is yellow fever outbreaks in Africa and South America?

Yellow Fever originated from West Africa, and branched to South Africa initially. The sequences from South America are more similar to sequences from West Afirca than they are to sequences from East Africa. There is a very low probablity the virus jumps from a monkey to a human being, and vise verse in all three regions.

2. What can we say about the distribution of Yellow Fever among this regions, East Africa, West Africa, and South America?

Generally the virus does not jump from one region to another frequently like other viruses do. It tends to stay in the area for a very long time until it branches out to other regions, but there is still a case where comes in  suddenly. This jump may occur due to migration of people or person from an infected area to a non infected area.
