<h5>Hypothesis:</h5>
<p>Since the only means for the transmission of the virus from any host to a human being is through mosquitos, the outbreak in both region started when the virus suddenly jumped from a mosquito to a human being.</p>
<ol>
<li>What can we tell about the host variation among this region?</li>
</ol>
<p>The fact that there have been a lot of outbreaks in Africa and Brazil make it suspicious  that almost all viruses in Brazil have a mosquito host not human. So my assumption is that researcher collected samples from Mosquitos in Brazil not humans.</p>
