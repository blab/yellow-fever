<h3>The first week, I studied the structure of Yellow Fever virus, and how it makes its way from one host to another. </h3>
<h3>Eventhough I touched on my virus research the second week, I spent most of my time coding with Python on Code Academy.(very useful!!!) </h3>
<h2>Yellow Fever virus</h2>
<ul>
<li>Yellow Fever was discovered in 1927. It is common in tropical and subtropical regions, mostly in South America and Africa.<\li>
<li>It is found in the   Flaviviridae Family and Flavivirus Genius. The virus is also called Arbovirus, because it is transmitted by the help of Arthropod vector (Aedes aegypti mosquitos). </li>
<li>It has a protein coat called Capsid. Its RNA serves as both the genome and the viral messenger RNA.</li>
<li>Yellow Fever is not a curable disease, but can be prevented. Its severity ranges from a simple head ache to liver disease with bleeding.<\li>
<h3><b>3 ways of Yellow Fever transmission cycle:<b></h3>
<ol>
<li><b>Sylvatic (Jungle) cycle:</b> is the transmission of YFV between non human primate and mosquito species found in the forest. The virus can go from a monkey to a human via mosquito, if their are humans in the area.</li>
<li><b>Intermediate (Savannah) cycle:</b>is the transmission of YFV from tree hole breeding Aedenspp to humans in the area, and it is very common in Africa.</li>
<li><b>Urban cycle:</b> is the transmission of YFV from human to A.aegyptis.</li>
</ol>
<h3><b>Symptoms of Yellow Fever:<b></h3>
<ul>
<li>It takes 6-8 days for the symptoms to show up during these time the infection will spread.</li>
<li>Initial symptoms include sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, backpain, nausea, vomiting.........</li>
<li>After a day 15% cases go to a more severe form of disease like Jaundice, bleeding, shock, organ failure.....</li>
</ul>
