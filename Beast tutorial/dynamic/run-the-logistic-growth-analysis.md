## Run the logistic growth analysis

**Open BEAST, select the file `pandemic_logistic.xml` and choose 'Run'.**

This will produce the output files `pandemic_logistic.log` and `pandemic_logistic.trees`, again taking ~16 hours to complete on a single cluster node.

I've included these files with the practical as `output/pandemic_logistic.log` and `output/pandemic_logistic.trees`.
